# Explanation: This program uses input() to get data, stores it in variables, and formats it with print().

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in cm: "))
print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old and {height} cm tall.")
